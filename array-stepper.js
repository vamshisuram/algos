array stepper
Write a function, arrayStepper, that takes in an array of numbers as an argument. You start at the first position of the array. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is possible to reach the last position of the array. When situated at some position of the array, you may take a maximum number of steps based on the number at that position.

For example, given:

    idx =  0  1  2  3  4  5
numbers = [2, 4, 2, 0, 0, 1]

The answer is true.
We start at idx 0, we could take 1 step or 2 steps forward.
The correct choice is to take 1 step to idx 1.
Then take 4 steps forward to the end at idx 5.
test_00:
arrayStepper([2, 4, 2, 0, 0, 1]); // -> true
test_01:
arrayStepper([2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 1]); // -> false
